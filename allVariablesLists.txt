 - POSITION Stepping of frames in one Image Box is synchronized by the stepping of frames in the other Image Boxes to effect an identical relative positional offset within the Patient-Based Coordinate System. This presumes that the referenced images includes Image Position (Patient) (0020,0032) and Image Orientation (Patient) (0020,0037) Attributes, and that the stacks have approximately the same orientation relative to the Patient-Based Coordinate System.
 - TIME Playback of frames in one Image Box is synchronized by the playback of frames in the other Image Boxes to effect an identical temporal offset from the original displayed frame. This presumes that the referenced images include Frame Time (0018,1063), Frame Time Vector (0018,1065), or Frame Reference DateTime (0018,9151). It also presumes that if the Image Box Layout Type (0072,0304) is STACK, the frames are referenced in a monotonically increasing time order in the stack.
 - PHASE Playback of frames in one Image Box is synchronized by the playback of frames in the other Image Boxes to effect an identical phase offset. This presumes that the referenced frames within each referenced Image Box constitute a uniform sampling across a single "cycle", and that relative position within that cycle is synchronized across all the referenced Image Boxes. For Image Boxes with Image Box Layout Type (0072,0304) value CINE, the set of frames to be displayed as one cycle may be specified either using the Referenced Frame Number (0008,1160) Attribute within the Referenced Image Sequence (0008,1140), or if that Attribute is not present, using the values of Attributes Start Trim (0008,2142) and Stop Trim (0008,2143).

Presentation Animation Style (00070,1A01) value of FLYTHROUGH shall be present only if Render Projection (0070,1602) is present.
 - SWIVEL Indicates that the rendered volume rotates around the "swivel axis", which is defined as the axis parallel to the Viewpoint Up Direction (0070,1605) intersecting the Viewpoint LookAt Point (0070,1604). The rendered volume rotates back and forth in the angular range specified by Swivel Range (0070,1A06) at a rotational frequency specified by Recommended Animation Rate (0070,1A03) in degrees per second. The display application should provide for smooth (rather than abrupt) changes in direction as the swivel approaches the limits of the swivel range.

PS3.17 sect_BBB.2 Use Case Actors
 - User Human being controlling the delivery of the treatment.
 - Archive Stores SOP Instances (images, plans, structures, dose distributions, etc).
 - Treatment Management System (TMS) Manages worklists and tracks performance of procedures. This role is commonly filled by a Treatment Management System (Oncology Information System) in the Oncology Department. Acts as a UPS Pull SCP. The TMS has a user interface that may potentially be located in the treatment delivery control area. In addition, TMS terminals may be located throughout the institution.
 - Treatment Delivery System (TDS) Performs the treatment delivery specified by the worklist, updating a UPS, and stores treatment records and related SOP Instances such as verification images. Acts as a UPS Pull SCU. The TDS user interface is dedicated to the safe and effective delivery of the treatment, and is located in the treatment control area, typically just outside the radiation bunker.
 - Machine Parameter Verifier (MPV) Oversees and potentially inhibits delivery of the treatment. This role is commonly filled by a Treatment Management System in the Oncology Department, when the TDS is in the external verification mode. The MPV does not itself act as a UPS Pull SCU, but communicates directly with the TDS, which acts as a UPS Pull SCU. The MPV user interface may be shared with the TMS (in the treatment delivery control area), or could be located on a separate console.

 - Standard CT Image (CT Image IOD, Enhanced CT Image IOD) Images created using ME techniques, for example, in case of the creation of conventional appearing CT images out of two energy spectra or images created with only one of the multiple energies acquired. No new image type definitions are needed but new optional Attributes are needed.
 - Material Quantification Image Family These image types characterize the elemental composition of materials in the image. They provide material quantification using a physical scale. Pixel values can be in HU or in equivalent material concentration (e.g., mg/ml). The following image types belong to this family:
 - Material Visualization Image Family These image types allow visualizing material content, usually with colors (color maps, color overlays, blending, etc.).
PS3.17 None -
 - Virtual Monoenergetic Image Each real-world value mapped pixel represents CT Hounsfield units and is analogous to a CT image created by a monoenergetic (of a specific keV value) X-Ray beam. In certain cases, the image impression (quality) will allow a better iodine representation and better metal artifact reduction. Monoenergetic images are sometimes colloquially referred to as monochromatic images.
 - Effective Atomic Number Image Each real-world value mapped pixel represents Effective Atomic Number (aka. "Effective Z") of that pixel.
 - Electron Density Image Each real-world value mapped pixel represents a number of electrons per unit volume (N) in units of 10
PS3.17 None These image types characterize the elemental composition of materials in the image. They provide material quantification using a physical scale. Pixel values can be in HU or in equivalent material concentration (e.g., mg/ml). The following image types belong to this family:
 - Material-Specific Image Each real-world value mapped pixel value represents a property of a material such as attenuation, concentration or density.
 - Material-Removed Image An image where the attenuation contribution of one or more materials has been removed. Each real-world value mapped pixel may be adjusted to represent the attenuation as if the pixel was filled with the remaining materials. For pixels that did not contain any of the removed material(s), the pixel values are unchanged. For example, in virtual-unenhanced (VUE) or virtual-non-contrast (VNC) image the attenuation contribution of the contrast material is removed from each pixel.
 - Fractional Map Image Each real-world value mapped pixel represents the fraction of a specific material present in the pixel. Since Fractional Map Images are generated as a set, the sum of the real-world values for all the Fractional Map Images is 1 for each pixel.
 - Value-Based Map Image Each real-world value mapped pixel represents a certain value for a specified material (the exact interpretation of the value range has to be defined by the user).
PS3.17 None These image types allow visualizing material content, usually with colors (color maps, color overlays, blending, etc.).
 - Material-Modified Image CT Image where pixel values have been modified to highlight a certain target material (either by partially suppressing the background or by enhancing the target material), or to partially suppress the target material. The image units are still HU, so they may be presented similarly to conventional CT Images. The values of some pixels in the Material-Modified Image are intentionally distorted for better visualization of certain materials (i.e. making tendon more visible). Thus, the image may not be used for quantification, unlike a Material-Removed Image, which can.
 - Color Image Implementations of Material Visualization Images use existing DICOM objects (Blending Presentation State, Secondary Capture Image (used as fallback)).

PS3.15 sect_H.1.5.3 Recommendations (Informative)
 - TLS This pattern provides SSL/TLS authentication and encryption between client and server. It requires additional setup during installation because the TLS certificate information needs to be installed onto the client machines and server. Once the certificates are installed the clients may then perform full updating operations.
 - TLS-Manual This pattern provides SSL/TLS controls for read access to information and require manual intervention to perform update and creation functions.
 - Basic This pattern utilizes the LDAP basic security to gain access to the LDAP database. It requires the installation of a password during client setup. It does not provide encryption protection. Once the password is installed, the client can then perform updates.
 - Basic-Manual This pattern utilizes basic security protection for read access to the configuration information and requires manual intervention to perform update and creation functions.
 - Anonymous This pattern permits full read/update access to all machines on the network.
 - Anonymous-Manual This pattern permits full read access to all machines on the network, but requires manual intervention to perform update and creation.
