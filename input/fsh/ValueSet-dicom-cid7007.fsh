Description :
"""
Context Group ID 7007 comprises the signature purposes codes of ASTM E 2084-00. The Coding Scheme Designator (0008,0102) shall be "ASTM-sigpurpose". The ASTM document defines the signature purpose codes as OIDs. For the purposes of this Coding Scheme only the leaf digit is used as the Code Value (0008,0100). ASTM E 1762 provides the full definitions for the signature purpose OIDs defined by E 2084. The recommended Code Meanings (0008,0104) are the titles of the definitions for the leaves of the OIDs. For example, the OID 1.2.840.10065.1.12.1 corresponds to the leaf "id-purpose-author", whose meaning could be encoded as "Author Signature" and whose Code Value is 1.
