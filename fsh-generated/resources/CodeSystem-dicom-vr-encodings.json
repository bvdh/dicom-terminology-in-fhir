Trailing null components of Date Time indicate that the value is not precise to the precision of those components. The YYYY component shall not be null. Non-trailing null components are prohibited. The optional suffix is not considered as a component.\nA Date Time value without the optional suffix is interpreted to be in the local time zone of the application creating the Data Element, unless explicitly specified by the Timezone Offset From UTC (0008,0201).\nUTC offsets are calculated as \\'local time minus UTC\\'. The offset for a Date Time value in UTC shall be +0000.\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe range of the offset is -1200 to +1400. The offset for United States Eastern Standard Time is -0500. The offset for Japan Standard Time is +0900.\n\n\nThe RFC 2822 use of -0000 as an offset to indicate local time is not allowed.\n\n\nA Date Time value of 195308 means August 1953, not specific to particular day.
